# IRIS_FLOWER_PREDICTION

Hello, I’m Sreenandu,I am here with my latest project based on machine learning
that i have done as part of my Data Science project.
I built this project to explore how machine learning can classify flowers using their structural traits. It represents my growing journey in data science and my curiosity about plant biology.


Every flower has a secret language.
Some speak through symmetry, others through the number of petals they wear.
This project is an attempt to decode that silent language using machine intelligence.
Feed the app a flower’s traits, and it reveals the floral type hidden beneath its petals.
