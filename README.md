# IRIS_FLOWER_PREDICTION

Hello, I’m Sreenandu,I am here with my latest project based on machine learning
that i have done as part of my Data Science project.
I built this project to explore how machine learning can classify flowers using their structural traits. It represents my growing journey in data science and my curiosity about plant biology.


Every flower has a secret language.
Some speak through symmetry, others through the number of petals they wear.
This project is an attempt to decode that silent language using machine intelligence.
Feed the app a flower’s traits, and it reveals the floral type hidden beneath its petals.

A machine learning–powered application that predicts the floral type of a plant based on its floral characteristics. This project combines plant morphology with data science to help classify flowers using measurable traits such as symmetry, petal number, and reproductive structures.
The Floral Type Prediction App takes in key floral characteristics and uses a trained ML model to predict the flower’s type.
This project demonstrates how classical botanical traits can be used to build an intelligent predictive system.
The mainly used technologies includes Python,Scikit-learn,Pandas,NumPy,Streamlit,Matplotlib and Seaborn.
